# Progression and Story Documentation

## Core Story

### The Master Orb Legend
In a world where power manifests as mystical orbs, legends speak of the Master Orb - an artifact of such immense power that its wielder transcends reality itself. Those who claim to have glimpsed it say it contains fragments of every other orb in existence.

### Player's Journey
As a Seeker, you've spent years studying ancient texts about the Master Orb. Your research suggests it's hidden in the Chaos Realms - a network of ever-shifting dimensions. Each realm must be traversed, and its challenges overcome, to reach the final chamber where the Master Orb resides.

### The Truth
The Master Orb is revealed to be the source code of reality itself - by obtaining it, the wielder becomes one with the game's systems, effectively becoming the game itself.
